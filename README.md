**PROGRAM 1**
**OBJECTIVE**= to find the first peak element in a given random one dimension array
**working**=This program finds a peak element in an array using a recursive binary search approach. The peak function calculates the middle index and checks if the middle element is smaller than its left or right neighbor. If so, it recursively searches the appropriate half of the array. If the middle element is greater than or equal to both neighbors, it is considered a peak, and its index is returned. The main function initializes an array, calls peak to find a peak index, and prints the result.
